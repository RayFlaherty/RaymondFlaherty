# Welcome To My Repo

A few things to get started, if you wish to deploy a local version of the sight, please feel free to clone the repo with https://github.com/RayFlaherty/RaymondFlaherty.git . Once the project is on your local machine, please run 
'npm start' from the command line. These steps will aid in viewing the code provided. 


## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide myself with a platform to showcase the skills and talents I have developed and will continue to develop through a further pursuit of education. 


## Current Project

The current repo is deployed through Heroku and there are plans to add a back-end to the project later. Currently, you will be able to read through a brief history of my life as well as take a look at some skills I have developed. A couple projects and the GitHub Repos associated to each project are also listed in the "Project" Section.

## Future Additions

As my education and skills continue and are sharpened, I have plans to add more features to this project. 

Firstly, if you take a look at the Nav.js file you will notice some content has been commented out. I am still learning how to use React and am wanting to add functionality with some links to help navigate the page. So users, in the future, will be able to navigate the project through the nav bar, as well as "Back to Top" buttons that exist in each module. 

Secondly, attached to the project is a "Server" folder. Inside, you will find I have created a simple Back-End.  The purpose of this feature will be to showcase my SQL skills as well as developing a CRUD application. My goal for this is to provide a comment section as well as an email form. The Contact Form is already created and rests in the Contact folder in the SRC directory. Now, enjoy the short youtube link below that shows the functionality of the comment section.

## I hope you enjoy exploring the project as much as I do working on it. It would be an absolute pleasure to have the opportunity to become and employee for your company and I look forward to becoming a valuable asset.
